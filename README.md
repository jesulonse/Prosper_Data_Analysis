# Prosper Data Analysis
## by Adewale Isaac


## Dataset

>This dataset expressses the various attributes of 113,937 customers of a Prosper bank from 2005 to 2014.
The columns display different attributes that can be used to describe customers that collected loans from Prosper bank over the period. The brief description of the columns of the dataset can be found in [Prosper Variable definition.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0) With these datasets, key decisions can be made with regards to loan types, volumes, customer types, period of frequent loan defaults, e.t.c.


## Summary of Findings

>In the exploration, I found defaulters of loans are customers that collected smaller loan amounts. Also customers with high credit score are not famous among friends as investors as the relationship is inverse. And that most customers with little or no investments from friends are famous with the Prosper bank as per credit score and count of investors investments. Among the employer status, it is observed that Employed customers took the highest loan amounts and are currently operating their loan repayment.Hence, Prosper bank is more interested in giving loans to employed customer for obvious reasons of their salary paying back on the loans. And they least gave loans to Part-time customers compared to the Retired customers. 
>The higher the debt to income ratio, the less likely a loan is given by prosper bank except for ouliers that had the maximum debt to income ratio of 10.01. And the reasons for this has been explained using the plots above.The Full-Time and Employed customers of Prosper took the most significant loan over the years. But across board of the employment status, we see that there is a slight decline in the loans in year 2008. This can be attributed to the recession in that year.


## Key Insights for Presentation

>For the presentation, I focused on the delinquent loans and performing loans and factors that made customers to default on loans and also perform on the loans respectively.
>Making use of univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots, I was able to make the following insights:
>Prosper ensures that they don't give laons to customers whose debt to income ratio exceed 1 but has exemptions of 10.01 for 272 customers with zero delinquent loans.
>Loans amount decreased around the year 2008, probably due to the financial recession of that year  but picked up from the subsequent year forward.
